Recently, I've been looking at [ReScript](https://rescript-lang.org/). It's a sort of blend between OCaml and JavaScript (that I don't fully understand?), but it looks pretty interesting and might solve some problems that I've been facing on the job lately (like building a tree hierarchy from a flat list of items), so I decided to try it and see if it might work.

I tried looking for tutorials on parsing XML in ReScript on `$SEARCH_ENGINE_OF_YOUR_CHOICE` (it doesn't matter which one, it'll still show up if you search "ReScript parse XML"), and I found this website that seemingly gives code that might work. However, it's only after about half an hour of trying to debug it that I realized... the whole thing is probably AI slop! 🤬

The telltale signs that I found were:
- SEO titles
- references to non-existent libraries (like `rescript-xml-parser`),
- AI-generated images throughout the website
- CSS that almost works but is slightly broken (you can smell the AIness in there, I don't know how to describe it but it's there)
- and of course, code that doesn't work.

(I will fix the caption above in the future)

This happened about a few weeks ago, but it's been on my mind for a while so I decided to dig a bit further. They have a LinkedIn page, so I begrudgingly signed up for LinkedIn (I've never had one until now), and lo and behold... Indians. With surnames like "Singh", "Kumar" and "Sharma", it's obviously Indian. (Not all of the stated employees have Indian surnames, but most of them do.) H-1Bs strike again. 😔🧑🏾‍💻
